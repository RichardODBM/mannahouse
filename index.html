    <h1>Welcome to Manna Hub</h1>
    <p>
      Just as manna was given freely each day to nourish and sustain, this hub offers a daily supply of Bible resources for you and your community. All materials here are provided without cost, so everyone can access God’s Word and tools for growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ODBM does not own these resources. They are gathered from around the world, made available by their creators, and shared freely for your use.
    </p>
    <p>
      May you find spiritual nourishment here, just as the manna in the wilderness fed God’s people each morning.
    </p>
